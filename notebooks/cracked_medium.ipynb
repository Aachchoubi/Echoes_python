      "abstract": "It is supposed that a region within an isotropic elastic solid undergoes a spontaneous change of form which, if the surrounding material were absent, would be some prescribed homogeneous deformation. Because of the presence of the surrounding material stresses will be present both inside and outside the region. The resulting elastic field may be found very simply with the help of a sequence of imaginary cutting, straining and welding operations. In particular, if the region is an ellipsoid the strain inside it is uniform and may be expressed in terms of tabu­lated elliptic integrals. In this case a further problem may be solved. An ellipsoidal region in an infinite medium has elastic constants different from those of the rest of the material; how does the presence of this inhomogeneity disturb an applied stress-field uniform at large distances? It is shown that to answer several questions of physical or engineering interest it is necessary to know only the relatively simple elastic field inside the ellipsoid.",

      "abstract": "The foundations of classical homogenization techniques, which aim at predicting the overall behavior of heterogeneous materials from that of their constituents, are reviewed. After introductory deﬁnitions and a methodological preamble, attention is focused on linear elasticity, for which the basic principles of estimating and bounding the overall properties are introduced and illustrated. In this context, special recourse is made for that to the solution of the inclusion and inhomogeneity problems as reported by Eshelby in 1957. Approaches proposed recently to account in a better way for the structural morphology of the considered materials are brieﬂy mentioned. The case of linear elasticity with eigenstrains is then discussed: several applications, including heterogeneous thermoelasticity, can be investigated within this framework. Finally, outlines of nonlinear micromechanics are brieﬂy reported from a historical point of view: from rate-independent elastoplasticity to nonlinear elasticity and viscoplasticity, examples of a fruitful interaction between the search for new estimates and the derivation of rigorous bounds are given and the crucial question of the description of intraphase heterogeneity is emphasized. Viscoelastic coupling and rate-dependent effects are brieﬂy discussed in conclusion.",
